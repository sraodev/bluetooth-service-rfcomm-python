# Protocol Specs (placeholder)

Use this folder to capture shared protocol contracts:

- Framing rules (length-prefix, retries, ACK messages, etc.).
- Feature negotiation for future transports (RFCOMM, BLE, Wi-Fi Direct).
- Security requirements (pairing, encryption).

Document changes carefully so every SDK/microservice stays interoperable.
