# Sensor Stream Example (placeholder)

Concept: stream structured sensor data (temperature, humidity, etc.) from an IoT
device to a gateway.

Implementation pointers:

- Extend the client data source to read from mock sensors or CSV feeds.
- Update the server sink to push readings into a time-series database.
- Document schema in `common/message-schema/`.
