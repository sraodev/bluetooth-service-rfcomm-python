# Go SDK (placeholder)

This directory is reserved for a future Go implementation of the Universal
Bluetooth SDK. Contributions welcome! Suggested next steps:

1. Outline the public package API (`btserver`, `btclient`, etc.).
2. Define how it will interoperate with the shared protocol specs in
   `common/protocol/`.
3. Reuse the message schema in `common/message-schema/` for serialization.

Feel free to open an issue or PR if you'd like to help bootstrap the Go SDK.
